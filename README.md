# Hostel_Classification_System

A machine learning model that can classify hostels based on various features such as price, location, amenities, and reviews. The model will take in data from various sources such as hostel booking websites, social media platforms, and travel forums to create a comprehensive dataset for analysis.

The model will be trained on this dataset using various machine learning techniques such as decision trees, Logistic regression ,KKN algorithm.. Once trained, the model will be able to predict the class of a new hostel based on its features.

The output of this project will be user-friendly that allows travelers to input their preferences and get a list of recommended hostels that match their criteria. This application will help travelers save time and effort in finding the right hostel for their needs, and will also help hostel owners improve their services and amenities based on user feedback.
